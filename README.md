# Leblad web api

## Overview
You can access the api documentation from here  [leblad-web-api](https://desolate-citadel-84572.herokuapp.com/docs/)
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.


This is a list of links that give a real data vs others that give a fake generated data, we are working on adding more

#### Real data links :

```
get /wilayas
get /wilayas/{mattricule}
get /wilayas/{mattricule}/adjacent
get /wilayas/{mattricule}/baladiyats
get /wilayas/{mattricule}/dairats
get /wilayas/{mattricule}/phone-codes
get /wilayas/{mattricule}/zip-codes
```

#### Fake data links :
```
get /wilayas/{mattricule}/baladiyats/{code}
get /wilayas/{mattricule}/dairats/{code}
get /wilayas/{mattricule}/dairats/{code}/baladiyats
get /wilayas/{mattricule}/dairats/{code}/baladiya/{bcode}
```
#### Links with errors : 
```
get /wilayas/{mattricule}/phone-codes/{phoneCodeId}
```


### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
